			<h2>BMW 5 Series</h2> 
				<p>BMW 5 or BMW 5 Series are business class cars produced by BMW since 1972. Currently, cars of the seventh generation of the fifth series are being produced. These cars replaced the previously produced BMW Neue Klasse series.
				<br><br>
				Initially, only sedan cars were presented in the BMW 5 series. The production of station wagons, called Touring, began in 1991. In 2009, the production of fastback cars was also launched, they are called Gran Turismo.
				<br><br>
				The first generation of the BMW 5 Series was fitted with naturally aspirated in-line 4- and 6-cylinder petrol engines. In subsequent generations, in-line 4- and 6-cylinder engines, 8- and 10-cylinder V-engines, both naturally aspirated and turbocharged, were installed. Since 1982, diesel engines have also been installed on cars of the series.
				<br><br>
				BMW 5 ranks second among the BMW series in terms of the number of vehicles sold, behind only the BMW 3 series. [1] The 5 millionth car in the BMW 5 series was manufactured in 2008, the 530d Saloon, painted in Carbon Black Metallic.
				<br><br>
				With the fifth series, the conversion of BMW models to three-digit designations began. In all generations of the series, starting from the second, an M version is presented, which is called the BMW M5

				The E12 is the first generation of the fifth BMW series, which was produced from 1972 to 1981. These cars were released to replace the BMW Neue Klasse series. The first commercially available cars, the 520 and 520i, were equipped with an in-line 4-cylinder engine. The following year, the next model was introduced, the 525, which was powered by an in-line 6-cylinder engine.
				<br><br>
				There is no M version in the E12 generation range. Nevertheless, the E12 generation M535i is considered the predecessor of the M5 models.
				<br><br>
				Models of the E12 generation were produced until 1981, but in South Africa, production of the model continued until 1984.
